					<h2 className="about-title">Addictive Alchemy Side Effects Workbench</h2>
					<p>Addictive Alchemy Side Effects Workbench is a companion web application for use on tablets, smartphones, or desktops that assists in setting up, and playing the card game Addictive Alchemy. The applicationâ€™s core feature is that it can allow players to randomly select 6 side effects to use in a physical game of Addictive Alchemy. These side effects are common cards used by all players, and are left in the center of the table during the game. Side Effects Workbench can pick these side effects completely randomly, or let players decide how fast, or slow they want the game to be, and how simple or complex the side effects that are used in the game will be. This will cause the random selection to be weighted in favor of those preferences. Once the side effects are selected, they will be displayed to the players just like in the physical game. Players can put their tablet or phone on the center of the table, and play the game with the aid of the tablet or phone. The application will let players click the side effects to flip them to the opposite side, and lock side effects to prevent them from being flipped per the rules of Addictive Alchemy.</p>

						<p>The Addictive Alchemy card game was designed by David A. Lupo, and was brought to life by countless supporters, and on Kickstarter. The art was created by the Belgium-based art team VectoriaDesigns.</p>
